# Contributing

The PyAvrOCD project welcomes all kinds of contributions, such as:

- general ideas and questions about PyAvrOCD,
- bug reports,
- documentation improvements,
- feature requests, and
- pull requests.

## Discussion

If you have a *question* or some *general ideas*, please do not open an issue, but use the [discussion forum](https://github.com/felias-fogg/PyAvrOCD/discussions) instead.

## Reporting an issue

If you have found what looks like a *bug* or a *documentation glitch*, or if you have a *feature request*, please open an [issue](https://github.com/felias-fogg/PyAvrOCD/issues).

Please include as much detail as possible. If you get an error message, please include the full log of the server using the option `--verbose all`.  In case of a bug, it will be very helpful, if the issue report touches the following aspects:

1. What are you trying to achieve?
2. What is your setup (OS, hardware debugger, software setup)?
3. What did you expect to happen?
4. What happened instead, and how does it differ from your expectation?

## Submitting Pull Requests

If you are considering a large code contribution, please open an issue first to get early feedback.

When you submit a pull request, do not change `CHANGELOG.md` or `release-note.md`.

## Code of Conduct

Everyone interacting in the PyAvrOCD project's codebase, issue trackers, and discussions is expected to follow the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct-link.md).
