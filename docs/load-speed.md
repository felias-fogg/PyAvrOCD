# Load Speed

The time to upload a new version of the firmware is, of course, a critical factor in the development process. Interestingly, there is a wide variation. In the tables below, you find numbers for a number of different configurations. All measurements are in kB/sec as reported by GDB's load function. To provide a perspective, the Arduino Uno bootloader programs an Uno at 7 kB/sec and verifies it at 10 kB/sec. So, you can upload and verify new firmware in less than 10 seconds.

The first number in each pair gives the speed when verification of uploaded code is switched off (`monitor verify disable`), the second number is for the case that this option is switched on (`monitor verify enable`). The first line in each cell is the speed of loading without a prior check of whether the code is already loaded (`monitor load writeonly`), while the second and third lines give the speed for read-before-write (`monitor load readbeforewrite`). The second line shows the worst case, i.e., no loaded page is identical with the file to be loaded, and the third line shows the best case, i.e., no page had to be loaded.

The first table is about debugWIRE targets.  As one can see, having verification switched on does not slow down anything. Further, even in the worst case, read-before-write is never slower than blind writing.

There are a number of interesting observations to make. First, there is never any difference between the verifying and non-verifying settings. Probably, the reason is that writing into flash is much more expensive than reading. In fact, the debugWIRE protocol requires sending at least 10 bytes over the debugWIRE communication line for each byte to be written into flash memory. Further, each page programming operation needs an additional 4 msec. Reading flash memory, on the other hand, is comparatively inexpensive, which results, second, in a ten-fold speedup in the best case when using read-before-write. Since read-before-write is never slower, it is adapted as the default setting when dealing with debugWIRE targets. Third, the mEDBG debugger on the Xplained Mini board has only half the speed of the other debuggers. I believe the reason for that might be that the debugWIRE line is used with only half the speed (roughly 62500 baud) because otherwise one might run into trouble with the USB interrupts that are also served by the mEDBG chip.

The next table is about programming the flash memory of JTAG targets with the default setting of 1 MHz for programming. Here, the picture is entirely different.

First of all, one notices that there is no difference between the different MCU clocks. The reason is that the hardware debugger generates the programming clock signal. Second, one notes that in the JTAG case, reading has non-negligible costs. The verifying setting has roughly half the speed of the non-verifying setting, and read-before-write halves the speed as well. The identical numbers in the third row have a simple explanation. Since this is the best case for read-before-write, i.e., no page has to be programmed, one also does not need to verify the write operation.
